## Our History

![[Pasted image 20221213133204.png]]

In 2015, Cqudefus was founded with the aim of providing businesses with tools for web design and app development. However, the team was not able to fully commit to building a client-based startup.

In 2022, Cqudefus has re-focused its efforts on innovation and creating solutions that bring joy to users. Our passion for the future drives us to constantly improve and create new products.
