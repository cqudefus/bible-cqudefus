An opportunity to take a step back strategic pause for thinking and refocusing. It’s the oxygen that allows our efforts to catch fire – it gives us room to innovate, strategize, reflect, recuperate and think. Go into a deeper thinking flow on strategy, creativity, and problem-solving.

The outcomes of “whitespace” efficiency should be attractive to workers at every level:

- Increased awareness of the cost of busywork

- A culture shift toward smarter use of work hours

- Reductions in email, reports, and other wasteful touchpoints

- More productive (and fewer) meetings

- Smarter use of technology

- Improvement in work/life balance

**Duncan**: Letting go of the unnecessary is a challenge for many people. What kinds of mental filters do you recommend for helping with the perpetual battle for simplification?

**Funt**:  It’s not a surprise in the age of overload, in which our greatest strengths can overflow and become liabilities. We’ve identified four main drivers that fit this pattern. They are all assets that have overgrown their pots and we call them the Thieves of Productivity. They are Drive, Excellence, Information, and Activity.

They lure us into a pace and pressure that actually can reduce our effectiveness. The drive becomes hyper-drive, excellence becomes perfectionism, information becomes information overload, and activity becomes a frenzy. However, they can be combatted with a simple set of four questions that map back to each of them.

- Is there anything I can let go of? (Drive)

- Where is good enough, good enough? (Excellence)

- What do I truly need to know? (Information)

- What deserves my attention? (Activity)

The questions work at the individual level, the team level, and the organizational level and are the cornerstone of what we call a Deductive mindset. When we commit to being Reductive, we develop habitual ways of thinking where we repeatedly surrender, let go, renounce, and strip away the unnecessary.
