# Prioritization:

Actually question the time sensitivity and motivation of each seemingly urgent request.

## After removing busyness:

There will be time gained after having this culture in our spaces. This time can be used for gaining perspective from yourself and your contribution, for entertaining innovative ideas that busyness has previously barred the door to, or for connecting more deeply with the why behind your actions. Those who use this time wisely will gain authority over their schedule because they can plan it more slowly, and they often find their executive presence increases because their nervous system is simply calmer.

## Make an appointment with stress:

One of the most vexing ways we lose white space is when it's hijacked by worry or ruminative thought. When something is weighing on you, large or small, it’s likely to be the first thing that pops into your mind whenever you have a free moment. And our minds can roll a negative thought around and around like hard toffee. It can make us almost afraid to pause. So, it’s great to make an appointment with those thoughts.

Let’s separate out emotion, which we always want to entertain in real-time. When an emotion comes knocking, pause, step away and let it arrive. But stress, usually seeded in rumination and worry, can be scheduled. The instruction is that when something’s weighing upon you, schedule a time to visit that heavy thought only once per day at a designated time. When the topic returns at any other time, remind yourself it’s already scheduled and try to move on.
