Our working window is 18:30 – 21:00, by the window it basically means the time you heavily get hold of your teammate.

Stand-up: We hold our 15 min stand-ups on **Monday** and **Thursday** at 19:30.

### Agile

We have a month’s planning.

- 2/3 weeks Sprints.
- Release Week
- White Space (Week)

Every week, we begin a new sprint on Monday and end it on Friday. During this time, we frequently do deployments. However, we reserve one week for releases and another week for "white space," during which we hold grooming on the last day of the release week and planning and retro on the first day of the white space week.

**Our Agile Methodology:** Lean Six Sigma

**Deployment:** Constantly any changes that are in RC (Release candidate/ Staging) should be released.
