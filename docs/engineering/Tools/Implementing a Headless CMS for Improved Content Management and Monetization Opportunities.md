As a company that frequently writes and shares content with the world, we are in need of a reliable and efficient content management system. We are considering implementing a headless CMS for our organization, with the goal of creating a lean start-up model for its development.

We plan on utilizing WordPress as the base platform for our headless CMS, and will conduct thorough research and analysis of popular headless CMS platforms such as Strapi.io, Sanity, and Netlify. We may even consider forking one of these platforms to create our own unique version.

One unique aspect of our headless CMS will be its ability to support multiple websites within our organization, with a single login page and customizable access levels for each user. This will allow us to manage content and user access seamlessly across all of our websites.

We see potential for monetization opportunities through the development and implementation of our headless CMS. We believe that our solution will offer significant value to both our organization and potential clients.
