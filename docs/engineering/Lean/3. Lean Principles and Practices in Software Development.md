Lean software development is a set of principles and practices based on lean manufacturing principles. The goal of lean software development is to maximise value and minimise waste in the software development process. This is achieved by focusing on the customer, often delivering small increments of value, and continuously improving the development process.

Some of the key principles of lean software development include the following:

* Finding and eliminating waste in the software development process, including activities that do not add value to the customer.
* Focusing on the customer and delivering small increments of value often instead of delivering large, infrequent releases.
* Embracing change and continuously improving the development process.
* Collaborating closely with the customer and involving them in the development process.

By adopting these principles, lean software development can help organisations to develop high-quality software faster and at a lower cost.
