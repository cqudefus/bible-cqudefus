*Genius and skills are not the not keys to building a solution or feature. The more important thing is execution and learning fast.*

## Policies

At our company, we prioritise team-based encouragement and individual rewards rather than relying solely on policies. While policies outline important guidelines, such as leave days, they should not dictate how employees live. For example, individuals should be able to make their own decisions about whether to get vaccinated.

## Theme

The theme of Cqudefus is the celebration of African cultures. Each country's head office should reflect the unique traditions of that country. This means that everything from the wall art and decorations to the food should highlight the beauty and diversity of the country's culture. We want our office spaces to reflect Africa’s vibrant and varied cultures.

## Apparel

The Cqudefus should have a line of stylish and impressive clothing that celebrates African and South African culture and themes, like what is available on the [GitHub shop](https://thegithubshop.com/). This would provide a unique and exciting way for our company to showcase our cultural heritage and pride.

## Working Environment

Our company strives to create a collaborative and inclusive environment where everyone's contributions are valued and respected. We believe that every person and every role is important in driving our success, and we encourage open communication and sharing of ideas. We want our team members to feel empowered to voice their ideas and take ownership of their projects, knowing their efforts are critical to the company’s overall success.

## Writing

Every year, each individual or team handles supplying feedback on the company's performance and suggests areas for improvement. This helps to ensure that we continuously improve and stay on track to achieve our goals.

## Feedback Loop

In all insights sessions/events

## Meeting Rules

To ensure efficient and productive meetings, all meetings should have a clear agenda and be limited to 15 minutes or less. In addition, meetings should only be held during the release week rather than sprints.

We use the Discord channel for most discussions and updates to help effective communication. However, private conversations can be held through direct messages if necessary.

It is important to keep Discord open and online to stay connected and available to the team while working on tasks. Please check regularly and respond to any messages to avoid delays or misunderstandings.

Overall, our goal is always to think and act leanly, maximising value and waste in everything we do.
