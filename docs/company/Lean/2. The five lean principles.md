A set of guidelines for achieving efficiency and quality in a manufacturing or production process. The five lean principles are:

### Find and eliminate waste:

Waste can come in many forms, including overproduction, unnecessary transportation, excessive inventory, defects, unnecessary motion, and waiting. Lean manufacturing aims to eliminate or minimise waste in all forms.

### Amplify learning:

Learning is essential for continuous improvement. In a lean manufacturing environment, workers are encouraged to learn new skills, experiment with new ideas, and share their knowledge with others.

### Create flow:

Flow refers to the smooth, uninterrupted movement of products or materials through production. The goal is to create a "pull" system, where work is only performed when needed, rather than pushing work through the system.

### Establish pull:

Pull systems are based on the principle of "one piece flow," where the completion of the earlier step triggers each step in the production process. This ensures that work is only performed when needed rather than pushing work through the system.

### Seek perfection:

Perfection is the goal of lean manufacturing. A lean manufacturing system can supply high-quality products at a lower cost by continuously improving processes, eliminating waste, and striving for perfection.
