Lean is a method or approach to streamline and optimise processes to minimise waste and maximise efficiency. It originated in the manufacturing industry but has since been applied to many other industries and business functions. The goal of lean is to create value for customers by finding and cutting waste in all aspects of a business, from the production process to the way that works is organised and managed. Lean is often associated with the principles of the Toyota Production System, developed by the Japanese automaker Toyota, and based on continuous improvement. 

This approach is based on 

## five key principles, or pillars, 

which are:
### Identify value:

The first step in the lean method is to identify the value customers place on an organisation's products or services. This involves understanding what customers need and want and designing processes and products to meet those needs.

### Map the value stream:

Once the value customers place on an organisation’s products or services has been identified, the next step is to map the value stream. This involves identifying all the activities and steps involved in creating and delivering value to customers and identifying any waste or inefficiencies in those processes.

### Create flow:

The third pillar of lean methodology is to create flow in the value stream. This involves ensuring that creating and delivering customer value is smooth and efficient, with minimal disruptions or delays. This can be achieved through techniques such as just-in-time production and continuous improvement.

### Establish pull:

The fourth pillar of lean methodology is to establish pull in the value stream. This means that production and delivery of value to customers should be based on customer demand rather than driven by the organisation’s production schedules. This helps to avoid overproduction and other forms of waste.

### Pursue perfection:

The final pillar of lean methodology is to pursue perfection. This means continually improving processes and eliminating waste to maximise customer value and achieve the highest efficiency and effectiveness. This involves using tools and techniques such as Six Sigma and Kaizen to identify and eliminate sources of waste and inefficiency.
